- **UI Libraries:**
    - Material-UI (MUI)
    - Ant Design (antd)
    - Styled-components
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript
- **Code Quality**: ESLint

### Architecture & Implementation

1. #### Component Structure
The application follows a modular component architecture:

```suggestion
src/
  components/
    search-bar.tsx         # Address search component
    address-form.tsx       # Address details form
    wast-type-selector.tsx # Waste type selection
    progress-tracker.tsx   # Step progress indicator
    styled/               
      index.ts            # Shared styled components
  mock/
    address-data.ts       # Mock address data
    waste-types.ts        # Mock waste type data
```

```

2. #### Implementation Approach

-  ##### Multi-step Form Process
The application implements a multi-step booking process:

1. Address Search
2. Address Form
3. Waste Type Selection
4. Skip Size Selection (planned)
5. Permit Check (planned)
6. Date Selection (planned)
7. Payment (planned)

- ##### State Management

- Uses React's useState for local state management
- Maintains form state between steps
- Implements step navigation with state preservation

- ##### UI/UX Design Decisions

1. ###### Dark Theme:
    - Enhanced visibility
    - Reduced eye strain
    - Modern aesthetic

2. ###### Glass-morphism Effects:

    - Clear visual feedback
    - Reduced cognitive load

4. ###### Responsive Design:
    - Mobile-first approach
    - Flexible layouts
    - Adaptive components

3. #### Key Features

- ##### Address Search
- Autocomplete functionality
- Real-time filtering
- Clear visual feedback
- Location-based results
- Memoized search results for performance

```js
const filteredOptions = useMemo(() => {
  if (!searchText) return [];
  return addressSuggestions.filter(...)
}, [searchText]);
```

- ##### Address Form
